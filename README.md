# Imaginary Worlds

This repository is a collection of my notes of imaginary worlds as I work on some world-building for various RPG sessions I run or am a part of.  It is a collection of notes, drawings, stories and other data that I may find useful.

I don't currently have any intention to make sure the data is clean, clear or consistent, but if you would like to use it, please feel free.

# Dareln Civil War

This war started in [Dareln](/understone/people/groups/dareln.md) in 278 BCE and continued until the [Dobluth-Elgghor](/understone/people/groups/dobluthelgghor.md) invasion in 274 BCE.  The republic was sufficiently weakened by the civil war that the Drow invasion was able to capture most of the republic's territory and it was never able to sufficiently recover.

## Society

The population was organized into guilds centered around various trades.  The guilds varied in size and prestige.  All free dwarves were a member of a guild.  Unguilded dwarves were effectively wage-slaves.

All government services were provided by the guilds via an exchange of wealth between the guilds.  For example, healthcare was provided by the Medical Guild and other guilds negotiated contracts with them.  Some common services, such as maintenance of the infrastructure, were provided through contracts negotiated by the high-council for which all guilds were a party.

## Government

Dareln was a mercantile republic.  It's primary governing body was the High Council.  This council was made up of representatives of the various guilds, as well as former members who were granted life-long appointments as advisors with limited power.

The role of the council was to establish contracts for the good of Dareln as a whole.  It's mandate was the ensure the prosperity of the republic.  This gave it the power to pass laws relating to inter-guild commerce and force participation in contracts that were deemed necessary for the greater good.

Each guild was responsible for nominating a representative to to the ruling council each year.  Many guilds held elections and they varied in how much public participation they had within the guild.

Council members were elected for a period of two years.  Once a dwarf had served at least one term on the council, they were granted the right to sit on the council for life as an advisor.

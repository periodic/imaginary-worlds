# Balthor

B. 833 BCE, D. 876 BCE

Balthor was a dwarven hero who stood against an Orc horde in 876 BCE with a small band of 12 other warriors and held a pass for 12 hours while Belinfort fortified itself.  Alas, he was lost and the Orcs defiled his body and resurrected him as undead.  However, in the siege of Belinfort he turned against the hordes with an squad of ghostly warriors matching those from the pass and they turned the tide of battle.

He is also known as the Son of [Burzraguth](/understone/places/burzraguth.md), as he was the first child born after the city's founding.

His stand was instrumental in solidifying the city's position and survival in its early existence.

# Cargenholm

Also known as the Red Temple.

Cargenholm was a [Dareln](/understone/people/groups/dareln.md) outpost in the [Thoral Mountains](/understone/places/thoral_mountains.md).  It is best known for its grand temple to Moradin, god of the dwarves. It also housed a small shrine to [Balthor](/understone/people/individuals/balthor.md).

The primary role of this outpost was to provide a route for the dwarves of Dareln to trade with the people of [Northdale](/understone/places/northdale.md) and [Kendal](/understone/places/kendal.md).

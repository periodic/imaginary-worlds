# Still Sea

The Still Sea is a large underground lake.  It gets its name from how still the waters are.  A pattern of stalagmites under the surface break up any building waves, creating a very still surface.

The sea holds three notable islands: [Angrom](/understone/places/angrom.md), Bethrom and Kelshan.
